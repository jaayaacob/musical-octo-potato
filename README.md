### Description of The Game ###

**Creature Warfare** is an engaging multiplayer game designed for 2 to 4 players. In this game, players embark on an exciting journey where they must answer challenging mini-game questions to unlock special abilities that allow them to summon powerful creatures.

Every turn, each player possesses a unique set of questions, and successfully answering them grants them the ability to summon their creatures(maximum 3 creatures). These creatures serve as formidable allies in the intense battles that ensue. Players strategically summon their creatures at their respective bases and engage in thrilling combat with other players.

The creature's strengths (attack value), and chances of success were determined by the random number. The outcome of the battles between creatures is also determined by a random number generator that takes into account the creature's individual chances of winning. So, there is a possibility that creatures with a small attack value can win against the creatures that have a big attack value which is a higher chance to be a winner of the battle. This aspect adds an element of both strategy and luck to the game.

**Creature Warfare** provides an immersive experience where players can test their knowledge, strategic thinking, and luck in epic creature battles. With its multiplayer nature and diverse range of creatures, the game offers endless possibilities for intense and engaging gameplay. So gather your friends, summon your creatures, and let the battles begin in this exciting combination of strategy and chance!
